=  Description: =

One program which defines different functions which take a given image and
builds a replica of the image, using a given amount of different pictures which
are used as pixels/pieces of this new replica.
The program does so by cpmapring the average RGB values (colors) of each piece
and compares it to the RGB of the area (the size of the piece) in original
image, and will place the piece with the closest average to the original.
Once all the pieces are compared and placed in there most accurate slots,
the mosaic copy of the origina image will be created.
